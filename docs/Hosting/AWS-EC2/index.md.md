- Learning how to host on AWS EC2
- Was more straight forward than I assumed honestly

2. Add inbound rules for port 3000
3. Login to the console
4. Install git and Add SSH
5. Now pull the repo
6. Create env variables
7. Start the docker service
8. Install Nginx for default port 80 and to get https
9. Assign domain by using Elastic IP and Route53

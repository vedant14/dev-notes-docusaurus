# My Jekyll notes
- Jekyll is a static site generator.
- When I came across jekyll it opened my mind to the possibility of hosting a site for free. And the amazing possibility of staticly generated sites
- Jekyll is pretty easy to wrap your head around. It took me probably less than a day to understand it.
